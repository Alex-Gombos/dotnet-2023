## Demo

Small project that showcases the first steps required to parse a PBF file.

## Complete

Reads, parses and interprets data from an OpenStreetMap binary file in PBF format. It extensively uses iterators in order to extract data on an as-needed basis and optimizes for memory efficiency rather than CPU usage efficiency. That being said, it supports reading per-blob data in parallel, which can speed up parsing significantly.

It can be used used to extract Way and Node information from a PBF file.
